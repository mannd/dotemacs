;;; init.el --- Initialization file for Emacs

;; Author: David Mann

;;; Commentary:

;; This is the Emacs â€œinit file after declaring .emacs bandkruptcy.
;; It is being converted to a literate programming format.  Stay tuned.

;;; Code:

;; Time Emacs startup.

;; Added by Package.el.  This must come before configurations of
;; installed packages.  Don't delete this line.  If you don't want it,
;; just comment it out by adding a semicolon to the start of the line.
;; You may delete these explanatory comments.
